    <title>Ticketing System :: LangChain AI</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/langchain_project_book/ticketing_sys/index.html</link>
    <description>Our company undertakes a project to offer operational and support services to one of our banking clients. A key component of this effort is the “Ticketing System,” a tool utilized by the operation team to record all customer inquiries. This system encompasses a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from password resets to more complex matters such as operating system restoration and disk failure. Once a problem is identified, it is forwarded to the expert team for resolution. The solution is then documented within the same system, contributing to a vast database of issues and their resolutions. On a daily basis, tens of thousands of problems and their solutions are logged in this ticketing system.</description>

      <description>The technical process generally follows this sequence:&#xA;Load the CSV file. Embed the selected data into a vector database. Create a compression_retriever that I’ll introduce in details Perform a similarity_search. Generate a prompt based on previous conversations. Define a chain with source data using RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain Send the output to the LLM for semantic optimization. The following diagram illustrates the main work flow of the data processing.&#xA;file CSVLoader file embedding database vectorstore file base_retriever file compression_retriever file llm file result CSVLoader -&gt; embedding embedding -&gt; vectorstore vectorstore --&gt; base_retriever compression_retriever &lt;- base_retriever compression_retriever --&gt; llm: prompt llm -&gt; result Figure 5.1 Work Flow</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we continue to employ RAG for data retrieval from the vector database, followed by processing with the LLM. However, to enhance data retrieval efficiency, we introduce a new feature known as the Contextual Compression Retriever.&#xA;actor user package data_processing { agent CSVLoader agent embedding } package base_retriever { database vectorstore } package compression_retriever{ agent ContextualCompressionRetriever } note right of compression_retriever:Enhance the context \nquality and accuracy\nand reduce hallucination package augmented { agent prompt agent llm } CSVLoader -&gt; embedding embedding --&gt; vectorstore:insert selected data\ninto vectordb embedding --&gt; vectorstore:embed user&#39;s query user -&gt; embedding: query vectorstore --&gt; ContextualCompressionRetriever ContextualCompressionRetriever --&gt; prompt:compression_retriever.invoke(query) prompt -&gt; llm Figure 5.2 RAG with Contextual Compression Retriever</description>

      <description>This time, we’re leveraging Mistral in GGUF format, which is compatible with CPU execution. The model is packaged by GPT4All. From GPT4All official website, it says that GPT4All is:&#xA;A free-to-use, locally running, privacy-aware chatbot. No GPU or internet required.&#xA;It’s open-source as well. To understand GPT4All better, you can get more information from https://gpt4all.io. We just download the model from GPT4All and utilize it with LangChain. The model can be downloaded onto anywhere on your computer and it’s operating system independent.</description>

      <description>Let’s take a look at the data schema of CSV again. Its structure is&#xA;ticket_number,date,caller,application,query,responder,solution,timestamp In this business scenario, we possess a substantial volume of data from call center logs, specifically related to IT support. This data is stored in a traditional SQL server and is exported into CSV or Microsoft Excel formats. The data is:&#xA;Well-structured, divided into specific columns The designated column for embedding and storing in a vector database includes the call resolution. Not all columns will be embedded. For instance, querying the caller’s name in the vector database is unnecessary. This decision is also pivotal from a performance standpoint when dealing with extensive data volumes. Neither too long nor too short in length. In theory, there will be no issues with token size for language model, as each column’s width is predetermined, similar to the data length in the example. In instances where the solution column becomes excessively long due to operators submitting lengthy documents as solutions, we can truncate the column and provide a reference to the full solution in the original database. This way, users can access the complete solution later if needed. Load the CSV and Define page_content for Embedding Based on the data schema outlined, the call log record encompasses various columns, such as the caller’s name and the timestamp of the call. These elements are not relevant to the call solution and, consequently, embedding them into a vectorstore can lead to increased computational demands and a decrease in search accuracy. Therefore, it is advisable to focus on embedding only the columns that are important for the end user’s query, namely the query itself, the application name, and the relevant solution. These are the key pieces of information that users are interested in retrieving.</description>

      <title>Defining Embedding Model and VectorStore with FAISS</title>

      <description>It’s a little surprising to me that Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) was released in 2017. An explanation from its official documentation:&#xA;… FAISS, a library that allows us to quickly search for multimedia documents that are similar to each other - a challenge where traditional query search engines fall short. We’ve built nearest-neighbor search implementations for billion-scale data sets that are some 8.5x faster than the previous reported state-of-the-art, along with the fastest k-selection algorithm on the GPU known in the literature. This lets us break some records, including the first k-nearest-neighbor graph constructed on 1 billion high-dimensional vectors.</description>

      <description>Load pretty print library and ignore some annoying UserWarning message. These are optional steps.&#xA;from pprint import pprint from warnings import filterwarnings filterwarnings(&#34;ignore&#34;, category=UserWarning) Remember to create reranker_sample.csv, according to the sample provided in Appendix in this chapter. And place it in the same directory of this code.&#xA;Use CSVLoader to load the CSV file and include only the specified columns in the page_content of each Document. Note that any columns not listed under metadata_columns will be included in page_content.</description>

      <description>In this chapter, we covered several key concepts and techniques:&#xA;We learned how to utilize the CSVLoader to efficiently load data from CSV files, enhancing the performance of our chatbot by ensuring that selected information is communicated effectively with the retriever. We continued to adhere to the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) process, which involves retrieving relevant information from the context to generate responses to questions. We used HuggingFaceEndpoint to manage and orchestrate the Mistral LLM. To further improve the quality and accuracy of the context, we integrated a ContextualCompressionRetriever alongside the base retriever. This step is crucial for filtering out unnecessary data and extracting only the relevant information from the dataset, thereby enhancing the efficiency and speed of our application. Before sending the prompt to the Large Language Model (LLM), we applied these enhancements to ensure that the context is both accurate and contextually rich, thereby improving the overall performance of our response.</description>
