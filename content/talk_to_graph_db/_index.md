<!-- In summer of 2024, I received a request from our Sales, who manages the engagement with one of public service customers. The client has multiple diementions of dataset and what they want is like

1. Link the different diementaional dataset together
2. Gives them a better graphical visualization of data relationships
3. As they don't have much technical skills, they can't handle SQL script and wish to just simply "talk" to the database in their native language. Then the data can be retrieved and visualized.

### Business Scenario

I'm going to simulate and simplify the business scenario. For example, the customer has a dataset of `fushun` city, which contains multiple dimensions of data, such as `population`, `economy`, `education`, `transportation`, etc. I just simulate to use 2 kinds of data, `population` and `education`, in which `population` is a table of `name`, `age`, `gender`, `income`, etc. and `education` is a table of `name`, `school`, `major`, `degree`, etc. -->


#### Request from Sales for Enhanced Data Management

In the summer of 2024, I received a request from our Sales team, which oversees the engagement with one of our public service clients. This client possesses multiple dimensions of datasets and is seeking assistance with several key objectives:

- Integration of Dimensional Datasets: They want to link various dimensional datasets to create a cohesive data structure.
- Improved Graphical Visualization: The client is looking for enhanced graphical representations that illustrate the relationships between different data points more effectively.
- User-Friendly Interaction: Given their limited technical skills, the client is unable to manage SQL scripts. They desire a solution that allows them to interact with the database using their native language, enabling them to retrieve and visualize data effortlessly.

#### Business Scenario

The client's request highlights a common challenge faced by organizations that rely on complex datasets but lack the technical expertise to manipulate them effectively. By integrating their dimensional datasets, we can help them uncover insights that are currently obscured by data silos. Improved graphical visualizations will not only enhance their understanding of data relationships but also facilitate better decision-making processes.
Moreover, developing a user-friendly interface that allows non-technical users to communicate with the database in plain language is crucial. This approach will empower the client to access and analyze their data independently, fostering a more data-driven culture within their organization. By addressing these needs, we can significantly enhance their operational efficiency and overall satisfaction with our services.
