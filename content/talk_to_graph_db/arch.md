### Architecture

#### Proposed Solution for Data Management and Visualization

To address the client's needs, I propose implementing an approach that combines the following elements:

- Utilizing `neo4j` as a Graph Database and Vector Store: We will leverage `neo4j` not only as a graph database but also as a Vector Store to import the client's datasets. This will facilitate advanced graph visualizations, allowing for a clearer understanding of data relationships.

- Running `neo4j` as a Service in Docker: By deploying Neo4j within a Docker container, we can provide a reliable and scalable graph database service. This setup will ensure that the database is easily accessible and manageable, enhancing performance and security.

- Integrating the `langchain_neo4j` library: To enable seamless communication between large language models (LLMs) and the graph database, we will install and integrate the `langchain_neo4j` library. This integration will allow the LLM to interact with the database using natural language queries, making data retrieval intuitive for users with limited technical skills.

- Using `ollama` to Orchestrate LLM Models: We will employ `ollama` to orchestrate the LLM models effectively. This tool will help manage interactions between the LLM and the Neo4j database, ensuring smooth operation and efficient processing of user queries.


```plantuml
{{< plantuml >}}

actor User
node LLM
database Neo4j

User -> LLM: Ask a question
LLM -> Neo4j: Query the graph database \nthrough `langchain_neo4j`
Neo4j -> LLM: Return the result
LLM -> User: Answer the question

note bottom of Neo4j: vectorStore
note bottom of LLM: orchstrated by ollama
