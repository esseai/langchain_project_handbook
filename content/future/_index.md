### LangChain and LLM are not Silver Bullet. 

They are not perfect and there are some areas that can be improved. 

The community of AI, or Generative AI, are growing fast and the technology is evolving rapidly. The growth of the community is unstoppable.

They're still experimenting and exploring the potential of AI. Some of the APIs are changing too frequently. That indicates the technology is evolving rapidly and the designer might not have a clear ideas from the beginning, reasonably.

LangChain has a lot of works to do including debug, documentation and maintain the community.

### Hallucination

The hallucination is a common problem in LLM. It may direct the user to the controversal direction. Specifically when an LLM is being trained on a large amount of data, it may generate some content that is not accurate and reliable.

Currently LLMs are being trained on a large amount of data, which is not always accurate and reliable. And the content and inference algorithm are not transparent. 

Honestly I don't trust some of the LLM from beginning as I'm sure the data fed into the LLM during training is particularly biased, in terms of politics, culture, and etc, which are based on the data selector's perspective and value proposition.

### Agentic AI

The current LangChain is a great framework for building LLM applications. However, it is not perfect and there are some areas that can be improved.

It would turn to manage and orchestrate agents, tools, and models.

It would emulate the human's thinking process and decision-making process.

It would be able to handle more complex tasks and scenarios.

I believe the future of AI is agentic AI, which is able to understand the user's intent and execute the task accordingly. And it would intentionally replace human's work in the future. I used to talk to my company's CEO about this and made a joke that all the administrators, who handle and process PowerPoint and Excel files, sitting at the entire floor 5 in the company would be replaced by AI.

### Get Involved in Open Source Community

My recommendation is to

- Keep watching the LangChain's development and updates
- Get hands-on experience with LangChain
- Get support from the community, such as StackOverflow, Reddit, LangChain's Discord, and LangChain's GitHub repository

What I'm doing is to
- Make everything open source
- Explore the potential of AI with my high curiosity
- Share my experience and insights with the community
