This chapter focuses on setting up and configuring a Python IDE, which is essential for advancing LangChain programming. The skills to be acquired include:
- Installing LangChain and its related libraries
- Establishing a development environment and relevant extensions in VSCode
- Configuring open-source LLMs from Hugging Face.
- Experimenting with locally downloaded LLMs while harnessing remote
computing power from the Hugging Face platform.

In the upcoming chapter, we will explore LangChain projects featuring real-world business scenarios for practical application. This will involve leveraging LangChain's capacity to orchestrate LLMs, utilize similarity search capabilities from VectorStore, and implement semantic optimization using open source LLMs.
